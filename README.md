Knocking the rust off my rust skills with a small raytracer... for fun!

## Features
 - Scene serialization from json file
 - Multi-threaded rendering
 - Basic shapes and materials
 - Shadows
 - Progress bar
 - Basic gRPC integration (gRPC branch)
 - Very basic image viewer (gRPC branch)

## Glaring omissions
 - refraction  
 - incomplete camera class  

## Ideas
[ ] torrance-sparrow  
[ ] path-tracing
