Knocking the rust off my rust skills with a small raytracer... for fun!

Glaring omissions:
 - proper matierals
 - recursion, refraction, shadows
 - other geometric types
 - incomplete camera class

## Ideas
[ ] get scene file and or distribute computation using tcp
[ ] torrance-sparrow
[ ] path tracing
